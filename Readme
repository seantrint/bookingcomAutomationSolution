Main - Test class, this contains the tests. Tests cover each star rating and spa filter (labels + functionality). In tests we use data keys as parameters for our methods.
Driver - Contains generic methods that execute javascript against the specified webpage (in this case booking.com). Parameters can be passed in with methods so they can be reused.
Page functions - Contains methods to execute the generic driver class methods in different ways. These are also generic as the parameter values derive from the classes before it.
Home Page, Search Results Page - Contains specific methods for specific pages and makes calls to the page functions class so we don't have to re-initialize driver object.
Test Data folder - These files have the test data. Test data can be shared among many tests, so 10 tests can use 1 data key and potentially in future can fix 10 test failures by updating 1 data key.
App.config - Specifies the application url we want to test and the location of the chrome driver
